    " Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used in the context of machine learning to represent categorical variables as numerical values. However, they are applied in slightly different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical values have an inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "It assigns a unique integer to each category based on its order or priority.\n",
    "The assigned integers represent the relative order but may not reflect the actual numerical difference between them.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a variable \"Education Level\" with categories like \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"Ph.D.\" You may assign the following ordinal encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "High School: 1\n",
    "Bachelor's: 2\n",
    "Master's: 3\n",
    "Ph.D.: 4\n",
    "In this case, the order of encoding reflects the increasing level of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding is used when the categorical values do not have a meaningful order or when the order is not important for the model.\n",
    "It assigns a unique integer to each category without considering any specific order.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a variable \"Color\" with categories like \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue.\" You may assign the following label encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Red: 1\n",
    "Green: 2\n",
    "Blue: 3\n",
    "In this case, the numbers are assigned arbitrarily without any meaning in terms of the relationships between colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Choose One Over the Other:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Ordinal Encoding when the categorical variable has a clear order or hierarchy, and this order is relevant to the problem at hand. For example, in the \"Education Level\" example, the order of education levels matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Label Encoding when there is no inherent order among the categories or when the order is not significant for the model. For example, in the \"Color\" example, the choice of encoding doesn't imply any meaningful relationship between colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between ordinal and label encoding depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the machine learning task.\n",

If the covariance is positive, it indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. If the covariance is negative, it suggests that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. A covariance of zero indicates no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
