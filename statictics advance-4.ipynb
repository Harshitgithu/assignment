    "Use Case: The t-test is typically employed when the sample size is small (usually less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "Example Scenario: Suppose you want to compare the mean heights of two groups of students (Group A and Group B).

    "Use Case: The z-test is suitable when dealing with large sample sizes (usually greater than 30) and when the population standard deviation is known.\n",

    "Definition: A one-tailed test is a statistical hypothesis test where the critical region of the distribution is on only one side (either the right or the left) of the probability distribution.\n",

    "Example: Suppose you are conducting a study to test whether a new drug increases the average recovery time of patients. Your one-tailed hypotheses would be:\n",

    "Continuing with the drug example, let's say the drug does have side effects, but the researchers fail to reject the null hypothesis that there are no side effects. This would be a Type II error – the failure to detect a real effect.\n",

    "In summary, Type I error involves incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis, leading to a false positive conclusion, while Type II error involves failing to reject a false null hypothesis, leading to a false negative conclusion.
